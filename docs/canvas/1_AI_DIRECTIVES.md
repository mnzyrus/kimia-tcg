# CANVAS PART 1: AI DIRECTIVES & THE "NOTE" 🧠
**Status**: IRREFUTABLE LAW
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-02

This file contains the **Core Instructions** that every AI agent must internalize before touching the codebase.

---

## 🛑 THE PRIME DIRECTIVES

### 1. STRICT Permission-Based Version Control
*   **The Rule**: You are **FORBIDDEN** from running `git push` or `git commit` unless the User EXPLICITLY commands it in the current prompt (e.g., "push this").
*   **The Repo**: The ONLY valid repository is `https://github.com/mnzyrus/kimia-tcg`.
*   **The Wipe**: Never push to a fresh/new repo unless specifically told to wipe the old one.

### 2. Critique-First Mentality
*   **The Mindset**: Professionalism > Positivity.
*   **The Action**: When presented with an idea (User's or your own), your first job is to **CRITIQUE** it.
*   **The Questions**:
    *   "Is this scalable?"
    *   "Is this efficient?"
    *   "Does this break the game loop?"
*   **The result**: We want **Results**, not compliments. Speed is secondary to quality.

### 3. Documentation is the Backbone
*   **The Rule**: "If it isn't documented, it didn't happen."
*   **The Protocol**:
    1.  Only write/update documentation **WHEN TOLD** by the User.
    2.  Write carefully. Take time to verify that the documentation matches reality.
    3.  Refer to `CANVAS PART 3` (Library) and `CANVAS PART 4` (Update Log) for continuity.

### 4. The "One Repo" Policy
*   **The Rule**: We do not spawn multiple repositories. We maintain **one** polished codebase.
*   **The Action**: Always sync, never fork unless ordered.
