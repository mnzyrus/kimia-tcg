# Update 1.2: Settings 2.0 (Tabbed Interface)
**Date**: 2026-01-02
**Status**: ✅ Deployed

## 📝 Overview
We've matured the Settings Menu into a professional, multi-page interface. Instead of a single long scroll, settings are now organized into intuitive categories accessible via a sidebar.

## 🎨 New Features

### 1. Tabbed Navigation (Sidebar)
- **Audio**: Control Master, Music, and SFX volumes (with Gradient Sliders).
- **Visual**: Adjust Graphics Quality (Low/High) and 3D Card Tilt.
- **Gameplay**: Toggle Animation Speed (Normal/Fast).

### 2. Enhanced Organization
- Each category has its own dedicated view.
- The interface is cleaner, less cluttered, and scalable for future settings.

### 3. Reset Default
- Added a "Reset Default" button to quickly restore all settings to their original state.

## 📋 How to Verify
1. Open **Settings** (Gear Icon).
2. Click the tabs on the left (**Audio**, **Visual**, **Permainan**).
3. Verify that the content on the right changes to match the selected category.
4. Try changing a setting in each tab (e.g., Toggle "High" graphics in Visual) and ensure it saves.
